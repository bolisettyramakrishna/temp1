// Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data and methods 

// that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java. Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation
//  details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.

// In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private, which means they can only
//  be accessed within the class. To allow outside access to the instance variables, public methods called getters and setters are
//   defined, which are used to retrieve and modify the values of the instance variables, respectively. By using getters and setters,
//    the class can enforce its own data validation rules and ensure that its internal state remains consistent.
